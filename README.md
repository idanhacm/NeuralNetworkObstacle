# NeuralNetworkObstacle
A small project i made in my free time using neural networking in a method of hill climbing.
this is my first project in machine learning using java.

The project is using neural networks with 1 hidden layer, 1 input layer(angle, player position and obtacle position) and an output layer with 3 neurons, turn right left or stand still.
I didin't use gradient descent because of the complexity of the program and the uncertainty of the outcome.
instead, each weight is changed one at a time to see if there is any improvement.
